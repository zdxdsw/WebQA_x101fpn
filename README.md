**Update (29 Sep, 2021):**
1. We realize that we've made changes to the source code of `detectron2` repo in order to run feature extraction described in [LuoweiZhou/VLP](https://github.com/LuoweiZhou/VLP) under detectron2 framework (because detectron1 is almost deprecated). For reproducibility, we release the source code under `WebQA_x101fpn/detectron2/` in this repo. There is no need to install the detectron2 package from [facebookresearch/detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)!

2. We clarify here what are arguments `--gold_feature_folder`, `--distractor_feature_folder`, and `--x_distractor_feature_folder`. Basically, during implementation we divide the images into 3 buckets: positive images for image-based queries (`gold`), negative images for image-based queries (`distractors`) and negative images for text-based queries (`x_distractors`), where the 'x' stands for 'cross-modality'. Image- and text-based queries can be disinguished via the "Qcate" field in the dataset file. Text-based queries all have `Qcate == 'text'`, while the rest are image-based ones.
